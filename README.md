At present, there is an existence of sites with news from one source and sites that have blogs from various authors, but no site that contains both news from various
sources side by side with blogs.This is the problem we aimed to solve with our project. The Information Pool System is an online-based web site that aspires to 
showcase news from various sites in one place. It aims to be the one-stop destination for people seeking information about current events of the world as well as 
find classifieds according to their requirements. It intends to become a single platform for both news articles and blogs posted by users, in order to provide 
impartial news to its users persistently.


There are mainly three types of actors in our developed project. They are:


Unregistered users

Registered users
	
	Blogger
